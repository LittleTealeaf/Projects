# Projects
Hi! This repository serves as a database to help navigate my endless maze of repositories on Github. As you might know, I am a Student at Quinnipiac University, and I like to post many of my projects on Github to make use of syncronizing between devices, sharing to colleagues, or submitting as assignments.

## Projects
| Project | Languages and Frameworks | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Pace Manager](https://www.github.com/LittleTealeaf/paceManager) | Java | A long-term project that I've been working on to replace a spreadsheet used to calculate winners at a local horse event. Along the journey, I've restarted the project multiple times, trying to learn something new and use a different utility each time.|

## Courses
Below is a list of the courses I've taken, and a link to a separate markdown file detailing repositories and projects that pertain to that course

| Course | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| [GDD-140 Creativity and Computation](courses/GDD-140.md) | I took this course as an introduction to using javascript. It utilises the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library and editor to teach and create generative art with code.|

<!-- TODO: perhaps make this into one of those github pages? -->
