# Projects
Hi! This repository serves as a database to help navigate my endless maze of repositories on Github. As you might know, I am a Student at Quinnipiac University, and I like to post many of my projects on Github to make use of syncronizing between devices, sharing to colleagues, or submitting as assignments.
