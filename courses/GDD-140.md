# GDD-140 Creativity and Computation
This course dived into using javascript along with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library to create art and digital media

Instead of using the online editor, I downloaded and created a template repository [GDD-140-Template](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Template) to set up a simple project that has the dependancies required to make a p5.js project. I coded exercises and projects using Visual Studio Code and published using Github Pages

## Projects
*(Aka, the more interesting stuff)*  
Each exercise set ended off with a project, which was a more open-ended assignment to let us experiment with implementing the topics learned in class over the week.
| Repository | Deployment Link | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Project 1.2](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Project-1.2) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Project-1.2/) | The task was to make a creative representation of a clock. I came up with the idea of having rotating circular disks as an abstract-style art. As a cherry on-top, I added in a simple smooth animation using a simple interpolation script. |
| [Project 2.2](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Project-2.2) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Project-2.2/) | The assignment was to create a randomized scene or art that would generate every time you clicked on the image.<br>I decided on making a linked-node based art that would randomly generate by branching out recursively. Later, however, I rewrote the project to add interpolation with a set of "rendered" rectangles, and "target" rectangles.|

## Exercises
*(The less interesting stuff, but stuff none-the-less)*  
Small little exercises submitted each week to demonstrate knowledge and proper use of topics learned in class
| Repository | Deployment Link | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Exercise 1.0](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-1.0) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-1.0/) | A simple exercise to demonstrate the ability to render a simple drawing on p5.js |
| [Exercise 1.1](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-1.1) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-1.1/) | A drawing exercise inspired by an abstract composition made by Piet Mondrian. |
| [Exercise 2.0](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-2.0) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-2.0/) | Demonstrating the use of animation and mouse coordinates to create a changing image |
| [Exercise 2.1](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-2.1) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-2.1/)| Demonstrating animation with smooth changes and randomness. I took this exercise and decided to push it as far as I can, randomizing the color, location, and size of an orb as it bounces around, leaving a trail.|
| [Exercise 3.0](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-3.0) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-3.0/) | Demonstrating both bouncing off the edges and looping items around the edges.|
| [Exercise 3.1](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Exercise-3.1) | [Link](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Exercise-3.1/) | Creating a simple button that will change the shape of another object on the screen. |
