# GDD-140 Creativity and Computation
This course dived into using javascript along with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library to create art and digital media

Instead of using the online editor, I downloaded and created a template repository [GDD-140-Template](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Template) to set up a simple project that has the dependancies required to make a p5.js project. I coded exercises and projects using Visual Studio Code and published using Github Pages

## Projects
*(Aka, the more interesting stuff)*  
Of each problem set, the third item (.2) was a project that required a bit more work, but was a bit more generic and open-ended.
| Project Repository | Deployment Link | Description |

| [Project 1.2](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Project-1.2) | [Deployment](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Project-1.2/) | The task was to make a creative representation of a clock. I came up with the idea of having rotating circular disks as an abstract-style art. As a cherry on-top, I added in a simple smooth animation using a simple interpolation script. |
| [Project 2.2](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/GDD-140-Project-2.2) | [Deployment](https://littletealeaf.github.io/GDD-140-Project-2.2/) | The assignment was to create a randomized scene or art that would generate every time you clicked on the image.<br>I decided on making a linked-node based art that would randomly generate by branching out recursively. Later, however, I rewrote the project to add interpolation with a set of "rendered" rectangles, and "target" rectangles.|
